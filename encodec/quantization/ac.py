    """ArithmeticCoder,
    Let us take a distribution `p` over `N` symbols, and assume we have a stream
    of random variables `s_t` sampled from `p`. Let us assume that we have a budget
    of `B` bits that we can afford to write on device. There are `2**B` possible numbers,
    corresponding to the range `[0, 2 ** B - 1]`. We can map each of those number to a single
    sequence `(s_t)` by doing the following:

    1) Initialize the current range to` [0 ** 2 B - 1]`.
    2) For each time step t, split the current range into contiguous chunks,
        one for each possible outcome, with size roughly proportional to `p`.
        For instance, if `p = [0.75, 0.25]`, and the range is `[0, 3]`, the chunks
        would be `{[0, 2], [3, 3]}`.
    3) Select the chunk corresponding to `s_t`, and replace the current range with this.
    4) When done encoding all the values, just select any value remaining in the range.

    You will notice that this procedure can fail: for instance if at any point in time
    the range is smaller than `N`, then we can no longer assign a non-empty chunk to each
    possible outcome. Intuitively, the more likely a value is, the less the range width
    will reduce, and the longer we can go on encoding values. This makes sense: for any efficient
    coding scheme, likely outcomes would take less bits, and more of them can be coded
    with a fixed budget.

    In practice, we do not know `B` ahead of time, but we have a way to inject new bits
    when the current range decreases below a given limit (given by `total_range_bits`), without
    having to redo all the computations. If we encode mostly likely values, we will seldom
    need to inject new bits, but a single rare value can deplete our stock of entropy!

    In this explanation, we assumed that the distribution `p` was constant. In fact, the present
    code works for any sequence `(p_t)` possibly different for each timestep.
    We also assume that `s_t ~ p_t`, but that doesn't need to be true, although the smaller
    the KL between the true distribution and `p_t`, the most efficient the coding will be.

    Args:
        fo (IO[bytes]): file-like object to which the bytes will be written to.
        total_range_bits (int): the range `M` described above is `2 ** total_range_bits.
            Any time the current range width fall under this limit, new bits will
            be injected to rescale the initial range.
